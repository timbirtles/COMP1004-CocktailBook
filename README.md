# COMP1004 Project - Cocktail recipe book
## 'COCKTAIL BOOK'
### Project vision/overview
This Single Page Application (SPA) aims to create an easy-to-use navigable database of cocktail recipes. Key features include a function that lets the user sort recipes by ingredients, and the ability for users to upload and edit their own recipes. The SPA’s purpose is to cater to people who are just starting to make their own cocktails and do not know many recipes or have many ingredients. There are already several websites that provide cocktail recipes, such as [bbcgoodfood](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/) and [thecocktailproject](https://www.thecocktailproject.com/), however I only found one that allows you to filter by ingredients and create your own recipes, called [diffordsguide](https://diffordsguide.com) and those features are locked behind a paid membership. Newcomers to cocktail making are unlikely to want to pay and therefore won’t be able to use these vital features.  
This SPA aims to solve this problem and provide a door into cocktail making.
