 COMP1004 Project - Cocktail recipe book

This Single Page Application (SPA) aims to create an easy-to-use navigable database of cocktail recipes. Key features include a function that lets the user sort by ingredients, and the ability for users to upload and edit their own recipes. The SPAâ€™s purpose is to cater to people who are just starting to make their own cocktails and do not know many recipes or have many ingredients.
